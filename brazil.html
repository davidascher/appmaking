# Introduction

### David Ascher, Mozilla Labs, Vancouver, BC

### I speak French, English, a little Spanish

### I don't speak Portuguese :-(

### If I speak too fast, wave your hands

# Mobile is a shift from _read-write_ to _read-only_

## The next billion internet users will only use phones

## Today's mobile world is built for consumption, not creation

## .punchline[_so what?_]

---
template: mozilla

# Lost opportunity

## The internet has changed the world because _anybody_ could publish

## For global personal and economic development, we need openness: having _many_ authors, _many_ use cases.

## .punchline[_let's do that on mobile!_]

---


## Current Mobile App Winners:

* Games
* Big brands
* Genius independent developers
* Control points (e.g. app stores)

## Losers:

* Civil Society (local governments, non-profits, â€¦)
* Beginners
* Ecosystem Challengers
* Non-developers &amp; most creative individuals

# We want every developer to be able to make apps.

# Can we do even more?

# One audience: Sophia

## No brothers or sisters, many friends
## Interested in fashion, writing; creative
## Likes using her phone
## Bored in school but ambitious

# The web stack is tall!

  HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Manifests, Web APIs, Storage, Offline
  Syncing,
  Appstores,
  Hosting,
  HTTP, CORS, Security,
  Responsive Design, Github, NodeJS,
  Packaging,
   â€¦

### .punchline[Great for web developers, _too much_ for most people]

---
class: center,middle

# Sophia could learn web development?

---

# If the first step is too hard:

most people won't try, or they will try the hard way and fail

&rarr; they never get to step 2.

&rarr; they think creating with technology is not for them.

&rarr; the promise of the internet passes them by.

### The approach:

.right-column.progressive[

## Start simple and _fun_; design is critical; learn from games
{{content}}
]

--

## Anyone should be able to make an app in 5 minutes
(make it addictive, progressive, relevant)
{{content}}

--

## Find an app, remix an app, make it your own
(Real programmers _never_ start from scratch!)
{{content}}

# Our Goal:

## We're happy when you feel _proud_ that you made a thing on your phone.

## &nbsp;

# Our status:

## Just starting &mdash; much left to do!

# How apps are really made

1. Find an app you like
1. Modify it
1. Add components
1. Connect components
1. Publish
1. Share

# Possible paths for Sophia

## Take a chat app, and make a place for her and her friends to talk
## Take a photoblogging app, and make a fashion app instead
## Take a recipe-publishing app, and make it share her poetry instead

---

# What success looks like

* Sophia enjoys making _her own app_

  * amused, proud, shares with friends
  * this doesn't feel like school or work, more like a game

{{content}}
--

* Sophia _curious_ about how app works

  * Starts to learn programming to make a component
  * Makes a fashion component
{{content}}

--

* Sophia builds an app that helps get her a _job_

# Appmaker Design Secrets

### Components are simple

### Channels are simple

### We build on modern web technology &amp; _hide_ most of it

---

# Appmaker is _not_:

* tools for developers
* teaching code directly
* for making big commercial apps

We want people to graduate from Appmaker to more advanced tools.

---

# What kinds of apps?

That will depend on what components we have.

Current focus is on simple, fun, personalizable.

* photos, music, camera, forms, stories, simple games
* chat rooms, lists of things
* apps for one person; apps for small groups (family, friends, colleagues)
* apps in service of "real world" small business: customer communication, simple payments

# Where will the apps work?

Appmaker apps are built on the web.

Today they work best on FirefoxOS, Firefox for Android

Work as web apps on other phones (offline, device access)

Over time, spread to more operating systems

# _Advanced_ recipe

1. Find an app you like
1. Modify it
1. **Create a new component** &rarr; how?
1. Add components
1. Connect components
1. Publish
1. Share

# What are Appmaker components?

## Using HTML5 Web Components

## Details about channels and attributes

---

class: center, middle

# Example component: Flickr


---

## A component is a new HTML element

```
    html <img>
    html <div>
appmaker <fireworks>
appmaker <chatroom>
     new <appmaker-flickr>
```

## Component definition has

* logic
* styling
* channels
* attributes
