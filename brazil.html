# .mozilla[mozilla] .wordmark[Appmaker]

**Mozilla is planning to democratize the mobile app ecosystem**

&mdash; _Why_ we think it's an important project

&mdash; _How_ Appmaker works (**demos** and some **code**)

&mdash; Apps, Components, Channels

&mdash; _How_ you can help!

# Introduction

## I speak French, English, a little Spanish

## I don't speak Portuguese

## If I speak too fast, wave your hands

# Mobile is a shift from _read-write_ to _read-only_

## The next billion people will only use phones

## Today's mobile world is built for consumption, not creation

## .punchline[_so what?_]

---

# Lost opportunity 

## The internet has changed the world because _anybody_ could publish

## For global personal and economic development, we need openness: having _many_ authors, _many_ use cases.

## .punchline[_let's do that on mobile!_]

---


## Current Mobile App Winners:

* Games
* Big brands
* Genius independent developers
* Control points (e.g. app stores)

## Losers:

* Non-commercial actors (local governments, non-profits, â€¦)
* Beginners
* Challengers of the ecosystem incumbents
* Non-developers &amp; most creative individuals

# Doesn't the web
# (FirefoxOS, â€¦)
# solve this?

---

# Yes, for developers

## We have the technical pieces in place

Domains, URLs, open source, FirefoxOS, Web APIs, â€¦

## The web stack is rich, but tall!

  HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Manifests, Web APIs, Storage, Offline
  Syncing,
  Appstores,
  Hosting,
  HTTP, CORS, Security,
  Responsive Design, Github, NodeJS,
  Packaging,
   â€¦

### .punchline[Great for developers, _too much_ for most people]

---

# If it's too hard to feel _rewarded_

most people won't try, or they will try the hard way and fail

&rarr; they never get to step 2.

&rarr; they think creating with technology is not for them.

&rarr; the promise of the internet passes them by.

&rarr; David is sad

### The approach:

.right-column.progressive[

## Start simple and _fun_; design is critical; learn from games
{{content}}
]

--

## Anyone should be able to make an app in 5 minutes
(make it addictive, progressive, relevant)
{{content}}

--

## Find an app, remix an app, make it your own
(Real programmers _never_ start from scratch!)
{{content}}

# Our Goal:

## We're happy when you feel _proud_ that you made a thing on your phone.

(For programmers: we're happy when you want to submit a component for others to use.)

# Our status:

## Just starting &mdash; alpha launched this week.

# Our audience: Sofia

* 15 years old, lives in a small town
* No brothers or sisters, many friends
* Interested in fashion, writing; creative
* Likes using her smartphone
* Bored in school
* Ambitious, not sure of her path

# The Appmaker recipe

1. Find an app you like
1. Modify it
1. Add components
1. Connect components
1. Publish
1. Share

---

# Possible paths for Sofia

* Take a chat app, and make a place for her and her friends to talk
* Take a photoblogging app, and make a fashion app instead
* Take a recipe-publishing app, and make it share her poetry instead

---

# What success looks like

* Sofia enjoys making _her own app_
  * amused, proud, shares with friends
  * this doesn't feel like school or work, more like a game
* Sofia curious about how app works
  * Starts to learn programming to make a component
  * Makes a fashion component
* Sofia **builds an app that helps:**
  * show her creativity
  * show her talent
  * show her ambitition
  * gets her a job

# Appmaker Design Secrets

### Components are simple

### Channels are simple

### We build on modern web technology &amp; **hide** most of it

---

# Appmaker is _not_ trying to:

* build tools for developers
* teaching code directly
* for making apps in appstores
* making conventional business apps

We want people to graduate from Appmaker to more advanced tools.

---

# What kinds of apps?

That will depend on what components we have.

Current focus is on simple, fun, personalizable.

* photos, music, camera, forms, stories, simple games
* chat rooms, lists of things
* apps for one person; apps for small groups (family, friends, colleagues)
* apps in service of "real world" small business: customer communication, simple payments

---

# Where will the apps work?

Appmaker apps are built on the web.

Today they work best on FirefoxOS, Firefox for Android

Use as web pages on other phones (depending on components)

Over time, spread to more operating systems

# _Advanced_ recipe

1. Find an app you like
1. Modify it
1. **Create a new component** &rarr; how?
1. Add components
1. Connect components
1. Publish
1. Share

---
name: component-structure

# What are components?

## A specific kind of Web Components

* new part of HTML5, being standardized
* Polyfill library in the meantime
* We use Polymer .url[(polymer-project.org)]

class: tutorial


### 1. Clone the repo 

`git@github.com:mozilla-appmaker/start-here.git`

(you can rename it)

```unix
$ git clone git@github.com:your_name/my-component.git
$ cd my-component
$ npm install
$ grunt # starts a server, gives a URL
```

### 2. Teach Appmaker about the URL (in the UI)

### 3. Edit/Save/Reload!

# Current Challenges

Need to test both relevance and design

* partnerships to test in real markets, and not just in the lab
* what does Sofia _really_ want to make?

Need more components

* it's a combinatorial system: needs more inputs
* what components will _you_ make?

Need more contributors

* hugely ambitious project: we need your help!

# Future

More apps, components, languages

On-tablet authoring

On-phone authoring
